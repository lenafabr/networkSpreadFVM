Finite volume simulation of concentration profiles spreading over network structures

This repository will provide Fortran code (and Matlab scripts for analysis) for conducting finite volume simulations of reaction-advection-diffusion processes on tubular networks. 

Public code is currently under construction and will be uploaded shortly.
